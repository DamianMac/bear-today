# Bear Today

A very simple templated "Today" page generator for Bear Notes.

Currently it is the simplest of spikes (Can I make a new note with dotnet core).

Plan is to add a markdown template.
Maybe call some APIs to fill in bits.

Going to tweak it a tiny bit every day to make the page I want to start with. It might be like a little kata for me.
